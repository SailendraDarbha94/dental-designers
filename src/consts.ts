export const IDS = "I learned industry-standard theory and methods for developing successful user interfaces. You now have fluency with the user research, prototyping and evaluation techniques necessary for creating intuitive interfaces that facilitate good user experiences. I demonstrated this fluency through an in-depth capstone project. Concepts and techniques covered include structured approaches for understanding a user base and their needs (e.g. contextual inquiry and design psychology), prototyping and design methods (e.g. low- fidelity and paper prototyping), and techniques for evaluating our design choices (e.g. heuristic evaluation, user studies)."
