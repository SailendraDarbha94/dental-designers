      Hello there! My name is <span class="md:mx-3 md:px-2 md:text-3xl underline">Sailendra Darbha</span>, and I'm a software engineer with a
      little over 2 years of experience in the industry. I'm passionate about
      designing User Interfaces that feel intuitively natural and for bringing
      them to life in a way that solves real-world problems and makes people's
      lives easier.
    </p><br />
    <p>
      My expertise lies in full-stack development, with a focus on web
      applications. I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages,
      including JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, and I'm comfortable working with
      tools and frameworks like React, Node.js, and Django.
    </p><br />
    <p>
      In addition to my technical skills, I pride myself on my ability to
      collaborate with team members and communicate effectively with
      stakeholders. I'm a natural problem solver and enjoy tackling complex
      challenges.
    </p><br />
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking in the mountains or playing
      guitar in my local band. I'm always looking for new opportunities to work
      on exciting projects, so if you're interested in collaborating, please
      feel free to get in touch. Thanks for stopping by!
